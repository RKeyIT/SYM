Everything user can track into SYM.



## Feauters

1. Moneys Control System:
    In first this system will take basic information about user.
    Information includes: day of payday, current moneys, count of saved moneys (sets by user wish) and etc.
    This information will saved on by user device and used for general functions into app.

       1) Acceptfull spends per day,
       2) Money takes/spends/saves.
       3) Full statistics info from first day of using app.
       4) Radial visual statistics.
