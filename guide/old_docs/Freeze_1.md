Leaved notes (do in first):
1. [TROUBLE] Functions is not calls again for colorize days in prev and next monthes.
2. [TROUBLE/BUG] MONEYS array must be filled by test fillings, but cleared after something (may be it was cleared by 'dailyOperations.length')
3. [REFACTORING] Project must be cleared from trash and cleaned code.
